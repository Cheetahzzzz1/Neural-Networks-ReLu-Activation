# Neural-Networks-ReLu-Activation

# Overview

This assignment focuses on implementing and analyzing a 3-layer neural network used for regression.

# Objectives

1. **Backpropagation code**
 
   Implement backpropagation for a 3-layer neural network with the specified 
   architecture.

2. **Training the Network**

   Use the single data sample x = [2,1]T, y = 3.

   Initialize weights with i.i.d uniform random variables over the interval (0,1).

   Train for 50 iterations using a learning rate ùõæ = 0.05.

   Plot the squared error loss as a function of iterations.

# Requirements

NumPy
